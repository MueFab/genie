# Notes on GCC:
# - GCC support for ISO C11 reached a similar level of completeness as
#   ISO C99 in 4.9 and that C++11 is feature-complete in 4.8.1, but support
#   for <regex> does not exist until 4.9.
# - Ubuntu 12.04 ships with GCC 4.6.3 and Ubuntu 14.04 ships with GCC 4.8.2.
# - On macOS, gcc is an alias for clang, and g++ is an alias for clang++.
#   So we must set CC and CXX to specific gcc/g++ versions.

# Define the build matrix explicitly. Manually expanding the combinations
# of (os, compiler) is more tedious, but grants far more flexibility.
