### Requirements

Filling out the template is required. Any pull request that does not include enough information to be reviewed in a timely manner may be closed at the maintainers' discretion.

### Description of the Change

The current documentation is lacking some description of necessary steps to properly install genie, making it difficult to follow for a user unfamiliar with the software. I have updated the readme with some key points that may help the average user successfully install and run genie.

### Benefits

The benefits are that people will have an easier time trying to install and use genie

### Possible Drawbacks

Some of what I added may be too specific and may need to be generalized.

### Applicable Issues

None
