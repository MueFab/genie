# Coding style

We use the **Google C++ Style Guide** available at https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html.

Conformance (and static code analysis) testing of a source or header file with regard to the Google C++ Style Guide can be done with the Python script **cpplint.py** (https://github.com/cpplint/cpplint).

cpplint related stuff can be found in the directory ``cpplint``.
