Here are some files which users of JBIG-KIT have contributed and which
I have included into the package in the hope that you might find them
useful. If you have questions with regard to these files, better
contact the respective contributors directly.

  These are four hierarchical project files for use with the Atari ST
  Pure-C development environment. With these files, installing
  JBIG-KIT should be child's play for Atari ST users (except the
  necessary line end changes in all text files).
